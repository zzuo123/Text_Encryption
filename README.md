# Text_Encryption
This is a small personal project I made with python. You can use it to encrypt your text (scramble), and no one can decrypt it unless they have the password. 

## How to use:
1. create a .txt file
2. copy and past .txt file location to code
3. copy and past text to .txt file
4. run the method encrypt (A two digit password will be copied to your machine and printed out, memorize it!)
5. encrypted text will be written to your original file
6. to decrypt, run decrypt method with the two digit password
7. decrypted text will be written to your original file
